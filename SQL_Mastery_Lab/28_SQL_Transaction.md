## üí° What is TCL in MySQL?

**TCL** stands for **Transaction Control Language**.
It helps you **control the execution of SQL statements** so that your data remains **accurate, consistent, and safe** even if something goes wrong.

üëâ Think of TCL like a ‚Äú**safety net**‚Äù for your database operations.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Why Transactions Matter?

Imagine you are transferring ‚Çπ1000 from Sunny‚Äôs account to Yash‚Äôs account.

- You withdraw ‚Çπ1000 from Sunny.
- You deposit ‚Çπ1000 into Yash‚Äôs account.

If one succeeds and the other fails (like a power outage üí°), your data becomes inconsistent.

That‚Äôs where **transactions** help  they make sure both actions happen **together or not at all**.

## üß© TCL Commands in MySQL
| Command                       | Description                                      |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **START TRANSACTION / BEGIN** | Starts a new transaction                         |
| **COMMIT**                    | Saves all the changes permanently                |
| **ROLLBACK**                  | Undo the changes (restore previous state)        |
| **SAVEPOINT**                 | Marks a specific point to which you can rollback |
| **RELEASE SAVEPOINT**         | Deletes a savepoint                              |
| **SET AUTOCOMMIT**            | Enables or disables automatic commit             |

## üèóÔ∏è Step-by-Step Example

Let‚Äôs go through a practical example using a banking system üí∞
```sql
CREATE DATABASE tcl_demo;
USE tcl_demo;

CREATE TABLE accounts (
    account_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    holder_name VARCHAR(50),
    balance DECIMAL(10, 2)
);

INSERT INTO accounts VALUES 
(1, 'Sunny', 5000.00),
(2, 'Yash', 3000.00);

SELECT * FROM accounts;
```

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ START TRANSACTION (or BEGIN)

Starts a transaction block.
```sql
START TRANSACTION;
```
## üí∏ 2Ô∏è‚É£ Perform Multiple Operations

Let‚Äôs simulate transferring ‚Çπ1000 from Sunny ‚Üí Yash.
```sql
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 1000 WHERE holder_name = 'Sunny';
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 1000 WHERE holder_name = 'Yash';
```
## üßæ 3Ô∏è‚É£ COMMIT

If both queries are successful, save the changes permanently.
```sql
COMMIT;
```
‚úÖ Now both updates are final ‚Äî data is consistent.

## üîô 4Ô∏è‚É£ ROLLBACK ‚Äî Undo Changes

Let‚Äôs say you accidentally updated the wrong account:
```sql
START TRANSACTION;

UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 2000 WHERE holder_name = 'Yash';
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 2000 WHERE holder_name = 'Sunny';

ROLLBACK;
```

‚ùå The `ROLLBACK` command cancels everything done after START TRANSACTION.

‚úÖ Your data goes back to the previous stable state.

## üéØ 5Ô∏è‚É£ SAVEPOINT ‚Äî Mark a Point in the Transaction

You can set checkpoints inside a transaction to rollback partially.
```sql
START TRANSACTION;

UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 500 WHERE holder_name = 'Sunny';
SAVEPOINT step1;

UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 500 WHERE holder_name = 'Yash';
SAVEPOINT step2;

-- Oops! You want to undo last step only
ROLLBACK TO step1;

COMMIT;
```

‚úÖ Only the second update is undone.
- The first one (Sunny -500) remains.

## üßπ 6Ô∏è‚É£ RELEASE SAVEPOINT

Once a savepoint is no longer needed:
```sql
RELEASE SAVEPOINT step1;
```

This frees up memory and cleans up your transaction.

## ‚öôÔ∏è 7Ô∏è‚É£ SET AUTOCOMMIT

By default, MySQL commits every change automatically.

To control it manually, you can disable autocommit.
```sql
SET AUTOCOMMIT = 0;  -- Disable auto commit
START TRANSACTION;

UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 1000 WHERE holder_name = 'Sunny';
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 1000 WHERE holder_name = 'Yash';

COMMIT;  -- You must commit manually
```

‚úÖ When autocommit is OFF, MySQL waits for your COMMIT or ROLLBACK.

## üß† Real-Life Analogy

Imagine you‚Äôre shopping online üõçÔ∏è

- Adding items to cart = making SQL updates (not committed yet)
- Clicking ‚ÄúPlace Order‚Äù = COMMIT
- Clicking ‚ÄúCancel Order‚Äù = ROLLBACK
- Saving mid-cart progress = SAVEPOINT

TCL gives you control before finalizing your actions!

## üîç Full Demonstration
```sql
START TRANSACTION;

UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 500 WHERE account_id = 1;
SAVEPOINT sp1;

UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 500 WHERE account_id = 2;

-- Oops, wrong user! Rollback last step only
ROLLBACK TO sp1;

-- Continue more operations if needed
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 200 WHERE account_id = 2;

COMMIT;
```
## üöÄ Key Takeaways
| Command                | Purpose                      | Example               |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------- |
| **START TRANSACTION**  | Begin a new transaction      | `START TRANSACTION;`  |
| **COMMIT**             | Save all changes permanently | `COMMIT;`             |
| **ROLLBACK**           | Undo all changes             | `ROLLBACK;`           |
| **SAVEPOINT**          | Create a rollback point      | `SAVEPOINT sp1;`      |
| **ROLLBACK TO**        | Undo up to a savepoint       | `ROLLBACK TO sp1;`    |
| **SET AUTOCOMMIT = 0** | Manual transaction control   | `SET AUTOCOMMIT = 0;` |
