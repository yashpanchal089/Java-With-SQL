💡 **SQL (Structured Query Language)** is the **standard language for managing and manipulating relational databases**.  
It allows users to **store, retrieve, update, and delete data** efficiently.

## 🔹 Key Points:
- SQL is used with **Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS)** like **MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server**.  
- It is a **declarative language** – you specify *what* you want, not *how* to get it.  
- SQL is used for tasks such as:  
  - Creating and modifying **database structures**  
  - **Inserting, updating, and deleting records**  
  - Retrieving data using **queries**  
  - Controlling **user access and permissions**  
  - Managing **transactions** to maintain data integrity

## 🔹 Why SQL is Important:
- **Easy to learn** and widely used in the industry  
- Supports **large-scale data management**  
- Enables **data analysis and reporting**  
- Essential for **backend development, data analytics, and business intelligence**

## ⚙️ 2️⃣ How SQL Works?
SQL interacts with a **Database Management System (DBMS)** to execute commands.  

**Steps:**
1. **Write a SQL query** – e.g., `SELECT * FROM students;`  
2. **DBMS interprets the query** – Parses, optimizes, and executes it.  
3. **Retrieve or modify data** – DBMS fetches results or updates the database.  
4. **Return output** – The results are displayed to the user or application.  

**In short:**  
**You write commands → DBMS processes → Data is retrieved/updated.**
