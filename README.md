Welcome to my **SQL Learning Repository** a collection of everything I’ve practiced, explored, and documented while mastering the art of databases.


I started this as a way to learn step by step, but it grew into something bigger  a complete SQL knowledge base 💡

## 🌟 What You’ll Find Here

I’ve covered almost every important building block of SQL from the basics to advanced. Each topic comes with real **examples, notes, and practice queries.**

Here’s a glimpse of what’s inside:

### 🔹 Fundamentals
- Database & Table creation
- Inserting, updating, deleting data
- Constraints (Primary Key, Foreign Key, Unique, Not Null, Default, Check)

### 🔹 Querying Data
- `SELECT`, filtering with `WHERE`, sorting with `ORDER BY`
- Aggregate functions (`COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, `MAX`)
- Grouping with `GROUP BY` & filtering with `HAVING`

### 🔹 Joins & Relationships
- `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`, `FULL JOIN`
- Cross join & self join explained with examples
- Venn diagram visuals for better understanding

### 🔹 Advanced Features
- `UPDATE` with conditions
- `REPLACE INTO` for insert-or-update in one shot
- Subqueries & nested queries
- Views for reusable queries
- Stored Procedures with loops & conditions
- Functions, Operators & Clauses

### 🔹 Database Design
- Normalization (1NF → 3NF) explained with notes
- Reducing redundancy & improving performance

## ✨ Why This Matters
- SQL is not just about querying data it’s about thinking in data.
- This repo is my step towards becoming fluent in the language that powers almost every app, website, and system we use today.

It’s not just a collection of queries it’s a story of learning, one file at a time.

## 🎨 Special Touch
**To make learning more fun, I’ve also added:**
- 📊 Diagrams & SVGs (joins, normalization, etc.)
- 🎯 Practical examples (products, orders, customers)
- 🖋️ Readable notes (written like a human, not a textbook!)

**💡 “Databases are not just about storing data, they’re about unlocking insights.”**
