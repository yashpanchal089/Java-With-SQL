## üìå Introduction
- Logical operators in SQL allow you to **filter records based on multiple conditions** in the `WHERE` clause.  
- They are essential for creating complex queries that combine multiple criteria.
- Every database administrator and user uses SQL queries for manipulating and accessing the data of database tables and views.
The manipulation and retrieving of the data are performed with the help of reserved words and characters, 
which are used to perform arithmetic operations, logical operations, comparison operations, compound operations, etc.

## 1. **Logical Operators ‚Äì Notes**

| Operator | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `AND`    | Returns records where **both conditions are TRUE** |
| `OR`     | Returns records where **at least one condition is TRUE** |
| `NOT`    | Negates a condition (returns the **opposite result**) |

- Logical operators are typically used in the `WHERE` clause.  
- Parentheses `()` can be used to **group conditions** and control precedence.

## 2. **SQL Code Examples**

```sql
-- Create database and table
SHOW DATABASES;
CREATE DATABASE company_db;
USE company_db;

CREATE TABLE employees(
    emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    age INT,
    department VARCHAR(50),
    salary DECIMAL(10,2),
    city VARCHAR(50)
);

-- View table structure
DESC employees;

-- Insert data into employees table
INSERT INTO employees (name, age, department, salary, city) VALUES
('Alice Johnson', 30, 'HR', 50000, 'New York'),
('Bob Smith', 25, 'IT', 70000, 'Los Angeles'),
('Charlie Brown', 35, 'IT', 80000, 'New York'),
('David Wilson', 40, 'Finance', 90000, 'Chicago'),
('Emily Davis', 28, 'HR', 48000, 'San Francisco'),
('Franklin Moore', 32, 'IT', 75000, 'Los Angeles'),
('Grace Adams', 45, 'Finance', 95000, 'Chicago');
```

- Logical Operators

1. Write a query to retrieve all records from the employees table.
```
SELECT * FROM employees;
```

- AND operator
2. Find all employees who work in the IT department and have a salary greater than 70,000.
```
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department = 'IT' AND salary > 70000;
```

- OR operator
3. List all employees who are in the HR department or are located in New York.
```
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department = 'HR' OR city = 'New York';
```


- NOT operator
3. Find all employees who are not in the Finance department.
```
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE NOT department = 'Finance';
```

- Combining AND and OR
4. Retrieve employees who are either in the IT department with a salary greater than 70,000 or are in the Finance department.
```
SELECT * FROM employees 
WHERE (department = 'IT' AND salary > 70000) OR department = 'Finance';
```

- Combining NOT with AND
5. Find employees who are not in the Finance department and are located in Chicago.
```
SELECT * FROM employees 
WHERE NOT department = 'Finance' AND city = 'Chicago';
```
